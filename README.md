# Street-Specification-to-Undirected-Graph

Given a set of streets, we can represent them as an undirected graph which can be visualized to highlight the endpoints of the streets along with the intersections that occur between the streets. This repository contains a program that takes in a collection of multiple streets represented as poly-line segments and generate a graph from them by outputting a list of all the vertices and edges in that graph. Such a program could be helpful for an entity such as the Traffic Department to analyze potential location of traffic cameras.
